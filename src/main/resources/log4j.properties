# this file is needed because for some reason, Mondrian (somewhere) hardcodes a dependency on log4j that logback doesn't pick up

# if you don't have a log4j.properties on the classpath, you'll get an error message from log4j about a missing appender for mondrian.olap.Properties,
#   and you won't get any log messages generated by Mondrian

# should look into this at some point, but for now, this will enable Mondrian logging
